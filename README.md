# ENLIL™ AI Governance Console

> **AI governance, risk and audit platform — backend-governed architecture.**  
> **Build:** 1.0.2-vertical | **Product:** ENLIL™ AI Governance Console

## What Is ENLIL™?

ENLIL™ is an **AI governance, risk and audit console** built for organisations that need real-time threat assessment, policy enforcement, tamper-evident audit logging, and operator oversight of AI systems. All security decisions are enforced server-side via a Node.js/Express backend.

The platform consists of six integrated modules:

- **SENTINEL™** — The Governor: Manages posture, routes all commands, enforces policy. *(Active)*
- **TITAN™** — The Nucleus: Performs deep threat analysis and risk scoring. *(Active)*
- **GUARDIAN™** — The Shield: Defensive perimeters and logic shielding. *(Roadmap)*
- **FORGE™** — The Smith: Logic synthesis and structural integrity. *(Roadmap)*
- **VENUS™** — The Scout: External intelligence reconnaissance. *(Roadmap)*
- **LASER™** — Override Protocol: High-privilege override protocol. *(Restricted)*

## Vertical Governance Mode

ENLIL™ supports **vertical policy packs** — sector-specific governance configurations that tailor SENTINEL™ policy enforcement, risk thresholds, and compliance alignment for different industries.

### What Are Vertical Packs?

Vertical packs are JSON-based policy configurations that define restricted actions, compliance frameworks, escalation rules, and two-person rule requirements for a specific industry. They are loaded at runtime and enforced by the SENTINEL™ engine.

### Available Verticals

| Key | Name | Focus |
|---|---|---|
| `ai_agency` | AI Agency Governance | Prompt injection, model misuse, client audit trails |
| `legal_professional` | Legal / Professional Services | Privilege, confidentiality, regulatory readiness |
| `construction_siteops` | Construction / SiteOps | Safety-critical oversight, incident accountability |
| `film_production` | Film Production Safety | On-set compliance, IP protection, content governance |
| `public_sector` | Public Sector Pilot | EU AI Act alignment, transparency, two-person rule |

### How the Active Vertical Affects SENTINEL™

- All SENTINEL™ decisions include `vertical`, `policyPackName`, `policyFocus`, and `matchedVerticalRules` fields
- Vertical-restricted actions elevate severity from LOW → MEDIUM and trigger escalation
- Two-person rule markers are included when enabled by the active vertical
- Only ADMIN and OWNER roles can change the active vertical

### What Is Logged to Audit

- Every vertical change is recorded as a `VERTICAL_CHANGE` event in the tamper-evident audit chain
- The audit entry includes the previous and new vertical key, the actor, and a timestamp

### Limitation

> Vertical packs are **rule/config based governance profiles**, not independently certified compliance engines. They configure the SENTINEL™ policy engine for sector-appropriate behaviour but do not constitute formal compliance certification for any regulatory framework.

---

## Limitations

- **Production-hardened MVP** — suitable for investor demos and controlled pilots
- **Not independently pen-tested** or certified under any compliance framework
- **TITAN uses rule-based analysis** — LLM provider abstraction is stubbed for future
- **GUARDIAN, FORGE, VENUS, LASER** are roadmap placeholders (not functional)
- **File-based audit storage** — PostgreSQL planned for production
- **SHA-256 password hashing** — bcrypt upgrade recommended
- **No MFA** — TOTP architecture ready for next phase
