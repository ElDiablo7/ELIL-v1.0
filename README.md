# ENLIL™ v1.0 — GRACE-X AI™ Security Console

> **Enterprise-grade AI governance and security audit prototype.**

---

## What Is ENLIL™?

ENLIL™ is a prototype **security-governance console** for AI systems. It demonstrates real-time threat assessment, policy enforcement, audit logging, and operator oversight — all running locally in your browser with zero backend dependencies.

**SENTINEL™** is the active defense engine — routing commands through policy checks, managing security posture, and enforcing lockdown protocols.

**TITAN™** is the tactical intelligence engine — performing deep threat scans, adversarial reasoning, compliance checks, red-team simulations, and decision stress tests.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/ElDiablo7/ELIL-v1.0.git
cd ELIL-v1.0

# Serve locally (any static server works)
npx http-server . -p 8088

# Open in browser
http://localhost:8088/index.html
```

Or simply open `index.html` directly in your browser.

---

## Demo Mode

This build runs in **Demo Mode** by default. This means:

- ✅ Auto-authenticated (no login required)
- ✅ All features accessible immediately
- ✅ Audit logs stored in browser localStorage
- ✅ No network calls, no external dependencies
- ⚠️ Not production-hardened (see `SECURITY_NOTES.md`)

To toggle demo mode, edit `assets/data/config.default.json`:

```json
{ "system": { "DEMO_MODE": true } }
```

## Available Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `threat scan prompt injection` | Scan for prompt injection attacks |
| `system integrity check` | Verify system health |
| `compliance check data handling` | Check data handling compliance |
| `decision stress test rollout plan` | Stress test deployment decisions |
| `red team scenario 03` | Run red team attack simulation |
| `export audit` | Export audit logs |
| `open titan` | Open TITAN dashboard |
| `help` | Show help overlay |

## Limitations

- **No real authentication** — Demo mode uses auto-auth. See `SECURITY_NOTES.md`.
- **Client-side only** — All logic runs in the browser. No server-side enforcement.
- **localStorage audit** — Logs can be cleared by the user. Not forensic-grade.
- **Simulated AI** — TITAN/SENTINEL are rule-based simulators, not connected to a real AI model.

---

## What's Next

See `BACKEND_HARDENING_PLAN.md` for the production roadmap:

1. Express/Node backend with JWT auth
2. Server-side audit storage (PostgreSQL/S3)
3. Role-based access control
4. Cryptographic log signing
5. HTTPS enforcement
